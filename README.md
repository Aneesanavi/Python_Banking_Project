The provided Python code defines a simple banking system:

It has a BankAccount class with attributes for account number, account holder name, and balance.
The class has methods to display the account balance, deposit money, and withdraw money, with appropriate checks.
The main() function facilitates interaction with the banking system through a text-based menu.
Users can check their balance, deposit funds, withdraw funds, and exit the system.
The code uses the if __name__ == "__main__": block to ensure it runs when executed directly.
In summary, this code creates a basic text-based banking system where users can perform account operations like checking balance, depositing, and withdrawing money.
